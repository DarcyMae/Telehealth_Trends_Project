# Telehealth Trends Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook "Telehealth Trends DataFrames.ipynb," which provides an in-depth analysis of telehealth utilization trends across different demographics and time periods. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that can help healthcare providers and policymakers enhance the effectiveness of telehealth services.

## Overview

The "Telehealth Trends DataFrames" notebook explores various aspects of telehealth data, including:
- Usage trends over different quarters.
- Demographic analysis based on age, gender, and location.
- Comparisons of telehealth usage before, during, and after specific healthcare policy changes or global health events.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis includes anonymized telehealth service records covering several years. Data sources might include:
- Public health databases.
- Insurance claim records.
- Patient surveys about telehealth experiences.

(Note: Adjust the above data source details according to the actual sources used in your analysis.)

## Tools and Technologies

The analysis is conducted using Python, with the following libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Key Findings
